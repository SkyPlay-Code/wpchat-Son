[28/04, 7:40 am] Sonali Ipsita•School: After 8:30
[28/04, 8:25 am] Me: Ok, sure. I will text you after 8:30.
[28-04-2025 09:05] Me: thank you for reaching out to me.
I'm here now.
Please tell me whatever you feel is important.
I will listen calmly.
[28-04-2025 09:11] Sonali Ipsita •School: Ya so I want to inform you that she's not well 
Actually now it's affecting her health so I thought I should talk 
I've got the whole scenario and just tell me one thing if you had this much things in your heart why u never shared it to her see I am not telling that you should not have your own privacy and all but she should be present even in ur that space if you're overthinking at any point u should have given a chance to  her to become an over explainer
[28-04-2025 09:14] Me: Thank you for telling me.
I feel terrible knowing that she's physically unwell because of me.
Honestly, I never kept her out of my heart or space intentionally.
It was my fear and overthinking that made me hide my struggles, not because I didn’t trust her, but because I thought I would become a burden on her, or that it will be just be too much for her to handle my negative emotions.
I realize now that she deserved to be there, beside me, and I made a huge mistake by not opening up.
I don’t want anything now except for her to get better, heal, and be happy, even if it takes time away from me.
Please tell her that I love her endlessly, and I am deeply sorry for everything.
[28-04-2025 09:21] Sonali Ipsita •School: U were never a burden to her bro why even this thought is coming across your mind ? Two people who are sharing everything with each other and a beautiful phase of their life together how could they be a burden for each other ? See till now I am not getting the trust in point of yours to her what made you write the message I mean the paragraph where it has been written that you can't trust her like is there anything which made you realise this or which hurt you ? And one thing I want to tell you is that you have said something to her like you have been with many and you have experienced that or something see I don't want to get into this it's your personal matter of course but before saying things like that think about it once because if who knows comes to your mind there is a answer that you know, you know everything brother she have shared you everything about her past life and all if she wanted to hide something from you she could .Because there is no one who can interfere between you guys and inform what has happened in her past.
[28-04-2025 09:21] Me: Sonali... there’s something more I want to say, because it matters a lot.
Even during those weak moments when I felt lost or upset, my feelings for her never changed.
I always trusted her. I always loved her with all my heart.
The emotions I wrote that time came from the weakest, darkest part of me, a part I never let win, a part I ignored because it only spread hate and fear.
Those weren’t my true feelings.
My real feelings, even in the middle of all the mess, were always the same:
Love, trust, and wanting her by my side.
I was closed off because I was upset and scared, not because I didn’t believe in her.
I regret hiding it, but I never regretted being with her, not even for a second.
I only wish I could have been stronger to show her that earlier.
Please tell her that.
[28-04-2025 09:31] Sonali Ipsita •School: I got it but you have to understand that everybody has a different sensitivity level . Your words may hurt people in a way you can't  even imagine . Ik bro you are going through a lot and many kinds of pressure of course but you have someone re open up to her . Don't have anything inside because it will make you depressed at a point. And U have the most beautiful person beside you so how can you be depressed? If anything makes you feel bad about her activity or something express it brother sometimes silence doesn't work. She can never think of anybody else being with you or idk maybe after you also if she ever gives an example of anybody else it's just to get the reaction of that possessiveness from you nothing else
[28-04-2025 09:35] Me: I need you to understand how deeply sorry I am for everything.
I know I’ve made mistakes, grave ones, and I can never undo what I’ve said or done. But I want to make it clear that it wasn’t my intention to hurt her, not for a second.
The truth is, I’ve been a mess inside, struggling with emotions I couldn’t even understand myself. I never meant to make her feel like a burden or distance her... it was just my way of dealing with my own emotions, which I didn't know how to process.
On the 18th, when we fought, I was numb and lost. I thought I was protecting her by pulling away, but it was a huge mistake. When she told me to fix my behavior, it hurt me more than I can express. But I now realize how wrong I was to close myself off.
I also said things about her past that I should have never said. Her jokes were not something that should’ve clouded my judgment, but I let them affect me, and I regret it so deeply. Even after she apologized, I still let that cloud my judgment and said things that I know hurt her. I should have forgiven her then, but I didn't, and I can never take back those words.
I know she trusted me, shared her past, and I broke that trust by acting immaturely. It’s the biggest mistake of my life, and I can’t stop feeling guilty for it. I feel so ashamed of myself, and I don’t even know if I deserve to be forgiven.
All I want to do is make things right and earn back her trust, but I understand that it might not be possible. I just wanted to let you know how deeply sorry I am for everything I’ve said and done. It was never my truth, but I said it anyway, and I regret it more than anything.
[28-04-2025 09:39] Me: thank you for everything you're saying. I know you're right, and I can’t deny that my silence and my inability to express myself clearly have caused so much pain. I’ve been holding onto my struggles alone, thinking I could handle it, but now I see how it’s affecting everything, including my relationship with her.
I never meant to hurt her, and I know my words have had that effect. I don’t even have words to explain how guilty I feel for everything. But you’re right, silence doesn’t always work. I’ve let it build up inside me, thinking I could keep it together, but it just hurt more.
She is the most beautiful person in my life, and I should’ve realized that sooner, I did, and she is the most precious one for me. I’m so lucky to have her, and I never want to make her feel like she’s not enough. I understand now that I need to express what I’m feeling, even if it’s hard.
And I get what you're saying about possessiveness, I realize that I can be that way sometimes, and it’s because I care so deeply. I don’t want her to ever feel like I don’t trust her.
I just don’t know if I deserve to have her love anymore after what I’ve said and done, but I want to fix things, and I’ll do whatever it takes to make it right. Thank you again for helping me see things clearer.
[28-04-2025 09:48] Sonali Ipsita •School: It's good to see that you realised what has gone wrong between you guys. And as a sister I want to suggest you something it's that age of our life which will never come back yeah I know what kind of pressure you have I don't want to talk about that but don't plan for everything let God plan something better for you.  planning is important but planning for everything will always show you some kind of unexpected failures ofc. Sometimes life needs to be uncertain.. 
And yeah you guys are good and mature enough to handle yaar just sometimes ahh alright so take care of every small step from now onwards okk
[28-04-2025 09:50] Me: Thank you for everything, Sonali. Your advice means a lot to me, and I’ll try to keep it in mind moving forward. I understand now that some things are out of our control and we just have to trust the process. I’ll focus on taking things small step at a time and not pressure myself or anyone else too much. I’m grateful for your support, and I’ll make sure to handle things carefully from now on. Take care as well, and thanks again for always being there for her.
